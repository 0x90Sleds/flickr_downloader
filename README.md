# flickr Album Downloader
## Why:
well, I was looking for a nice wallpapers and found these amazing photos by Masashi Wakui on flickr. 
tried downloading, but apparently flickr was not letting me. So I wrote a code to do that. 
In order to use this you will need an API key and secret Key for Flickr, 
also code will ask you for the userID of the album you want to download and the albums ID as well. 
After that, you will be asked what quality of the pictures you want. </br>
I ran into a little problem where some of the photos were unnamed, so had to improvise. 
All the pictures will be saved into a folder called 'images; </br>
Do not worry, code will create a folder by itself.
