# flickr Album Downloader
## Why:
well, I was looking for a nice wallpapers and found these amazing photos by Masashi Wakui on flickr. </br>
tried downloading, but apparently flickr was not allowing any downloads.</br>
If I was to do it manually, then I would have to open each one of the pictures, click to download, </br>
then click to choose the size, open inspect elements, find the link to the image, </br>
copy, paste it to download. Annoying, isnt't it?</br>
</br>
So I wrote a code to do that. </br>
In order to use this you will need an API key and secret Key for Flickr, </br>
also code will ask you for the userID of the album you want to download and the albums ID as well. </br>
After that, you will be asked what quality of the pictures you want. </br>
I ran into a little problem where some of the photos were unnamed, so had to improvise. </br>
All the pictures will be saved into a folder called 'images; </br>
Do not worry, code will create a folder by itself.
